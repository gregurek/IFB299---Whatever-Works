			<h2>What is BookBook?</h2>
			</br>
			<p>Welcome to our website!</p>
			</br>
			<p>Started up in 2015, BookBook is an alternative for QUT students looking to get their semester textbooks without the hassle and the unnecessary debt that follows. BookBook connects QUT students who already have textbooks and allows them to communicate with each other, QUT students are then able sort out a deal by themselves which eliminates the need to go to the bookshop and spending an extra $300 every semester.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Thank you for taking advantage of our unique service to get your textbooks for the semester and we hope you have a great experience!</p>

			<h2>Why we made BookBook?</h2>
			</br>
			<p>As university students, we can all agree on how stressful university can be when you’re studying 30 hours and working another 20 hours every week to dine on instant noodles because you’ve spent all your money on those textbooks that you didn’t even need. Most of us have gone through this at least once, so we decided to come up with a solution to try save as much money for students. Our main goal when starting BookBook was for students to be able get their textbooks for the semester and still have a little money left over for a more suitable dinner like cereal.</p>
